1.Descriptive Statistics- Mean, Median, Mode
2.Sample- A sample is a subset of the population.
  We study the sample to make inferences (educated guesses) about the population, because studying the whole population is often too time- consuming or expensive.

Types of Descriptive Statistics
1.Frequency Tables
2.Measures of Central Tendency
3.Measures of Variability
4.Measures of Position
5.Measures of Shape

Types of Sampling
1.Simple Random Sampling-
Example: You have 1000 customers and randomly choose 100 using Excel's RAND() function.

2.Systematic Sampling-
Example: You have 1000 customers and need 100.Interval= 1000/100= 101000/100=101000/100=10
Pick every 10th customer from the list after a random start.

3.Stratified Sampling-
Example: You want opinions from 1000 customers: 60% Male, 40% Female

4.Cluster Sampling-
Example: You want to survey schools in Gujarat. Divide all schools into clusters by district.


Types of Data/Variables
1.Qualitative (Categorical) Data
  Describes qualities/categories,not numbers
  Cannot be measured, only labeled or classified
Types:
1.Nominal Data
Categories with no order
Just names/labels.
Examples: Gender(Male/Female),Blood Group(A,B,AB,O),Colors(Red,Blue).
2.Ordinal Data
Categories with a meaningful order but the differences are not measurable
Examples: Rank in class (1st,2nd,3rd), Customer feedback (Poor, Average, Good, Excellent).

2.Quantitative (Numerical) Data
Represents numbers that can be measured can perform mathematical operations.

Types:
1.Discrete Data
  Countable, whole numbers.
Examples: Number of children in a family, Number of books on a shelf, Dice outcomes(1-6)

2.Continuous Data
can take any value within a range (decimals, fractions included). Examples: Height, Weight, Time, Temperature

EXERCISE
Marks in exam (out of 100)- discrete
Favourite sport(Cricket, Football, Basketball) nominal.
Ranking in singing competition- ordinal
Number of siblings- discrete
Body temperature- continues.

Type of Descriptive Statistics
Frequency Tables- Frequency Table Histogram
Measures of Central Tendency- Mean, Median, Mode
Measures of Variability- Variance, Standard Deviation, MAD, Range.
Measures of Position- Quartile, Percentile, IQR
Measures of Shape- Skewness, Kurtosis, Box, Plot, Distribution

Data=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
Mean= 1+2+3+4+5+6/6=21/6=3.5
Median= 3+4/2=3.5


Data=[3,3,5,4,2,3,3]
Median= 4
Mode= 3

Standard Deviation= Variance total Square Root

Discrete Distribution-
(a)Uniform Distribution-(Discrete)
All values in a finite set have the same probability P(x)=1/n
where n= number of possible outcomes Rolling a fair 6-sided die
Each number(1-6) has a 1/6=16.67% chance
Use Case: Random assignment in A/B testing, simulations where every outcome is equally likely

(b)Bernoulli Distribution- A binary outcome either success(1) or failure (0) with probability p of success
RAND() generates a random number between 0 and 1.
If it's less than 0.3- it's a "success"(1), else "fail"(0)

(c)Geometric Distribution- Number of trials until first success You want to know on which try the first success happens.

(d)Poisson Distribution- Counts number of events in a time frame

Example- If on average you get 4 customer queries per hour, what's the probability of getting 2 in an hour?
POISSON.DIST(2,4,FALSE)=0.146525111

What is the Gamma Function?
The Gamma Function is just a fancy version of factorial that also works for decimal numbers.

Number             Factorial(n!)
1                  
2                  2*1=2
3                  3*2*1=6
4                  4*3*2*1=24
The Gamma Function is written as:
     
    Formula
GAMMA (5)     (n)
GAMMA.DIST(2,3,2,TRUE)   (n)=(n-1)!
This uses the Gamma Distribution, which models: "Time until multiple events happen".
If you want the time until 1 event, you use Exponential
If you want time until 3 events, use Gamma (with shape= 3).

What is the probability that the time until the 3rd event (like 3rd customer call) happens within 2 minutes, if each event takes 2 minutes on average? =GAMMA.DIST(2,3,2,TRUE)->0.1804

There is 18.04% chance that all 3 events happen within 2 minutes when each event takes 2 minutes on average
