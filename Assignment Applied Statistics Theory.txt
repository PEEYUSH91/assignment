                               Frequency Distribution

What is Frequency Distribution?
A frequency distribution shows how many times (frequency) each value or class interval appears in a dataset.

                               Correlation Matrix

1. What is Correlation?

Correlation measures the degree and direction of relationship between two quantitative variables.

Shows how one variable changes when another changes

Value ranges from –1 to +1

2. Types of Correlation Values
Correlation Value	Meaning
+1	Perfect positive correlation
–1	Perfect negative correlation
0	No correlation
0 < r < 1	Positive correlation
–1 < r < 0	Negative correlation

3. What is a Correlation Matrix?

A correlation matrix is a table that shows correlation coefficients between multiple variables simultaneously.

Example:
If you have Height, Weight, Age, the matrix shows:

Height vs Weight

Height vs Age

Weight vs Age

4. Correlation Formula (Pearson’s Correlation)


r= ​∑(X−Xˉ)(Y−Yˉ)​/
   ∑(X−Xˉ)2∑(Y−Yˉ)2

                                  Descriptive Statistics

1. What is Descriptive Statistics?

Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistics used to summarize, organize, and describe data using numerical measures and tables.

It helps to:

Understand data behavior

Identify patterns

Compare datasets

2. Types of Descriptive Statistics
(A) Measures of Central Tendency

Describe the center of the data.

Measure	      Meaning	                  Excel  Formula
Mean	      Average value	          =AVERAGE(range)
Median	      Middle value	          =MEDIAN(range)
Mode	      Most frequent value	  =MODE.SNGL(range)

(B) Measures of Dispersion

Describe the spread of the data.

Measure	                Meaning	                       Excel Formula
Range	                Max – Min	                       =MAX(range)-MIN(range)
Variance                Data variability	               =VAR.P() / =VAR.S()
Standard Deviation	Spread around mean                     =STDEV.P() / =STDEV.S()

(C) Measures of Shape

Describe the distribution pattern.

Measure	        Meaning	                Excel Formula
Skewness	Symmetry of data	=SKEW(range)
Kurtosis	Peakedness of data	=KURT(range)


Advantages of Descriptive Statistics

Simplifies large data

Easy comparison

Useful for business & research decisions

Limitations

Cannot make predictions

No cause-effect relationship

Limited to given data

                      Normal Distribution Using Excel
1. What is Normal Distribution?

A normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is:

Symmetrical

Bell-shaped

Mean = Median = Mode

It is also called Gaussian Distribution.

2. Properties of Normal Distribution

Bell-shaped curve

Symmetrical about the mean

Mean = Median = Mode

Total area under curve = 1

Defined by two parameters:

Mean (μ)

Standard Deviation (σ)

3. Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 Rule)
Range	% of Data
μ ± 1σ	68%
μ ± 2σ	95%
μ ± 3σ	99.7%

5. Normal Distribution Functions in Excel
Purpose	                        Excel Function
Probability Density Function	NORM.DIST()
Cumulative Probability	        NORM.DIST(…, TRUE)
Z-Score	                        (x – mean) / std dev
Standard Normal Distribution	NORM.S.DIST()
Inverse Normal	                NORM.INV()
Inverse Standard Normal	        NORM.S.INV()

Interpretation

Higher σ → Wider curve

Lower σ → Narrow curve

Higher μ → Curve shifts right

Symmetric distribution indicates normality

Applications of Normal Distribution

Exam marks analysis

Quality control

Finance & risk analysis

Business forecasting

Research studies

Advantages

Simple & well-defined

Used widely in statistics

Good approximation for real-world data

Limitations

Not suitable for skewed data

Sensitive to outliers

Assumes continuous data


                               Sample Size Calculator using Excel
1. What is Sample Size?

Sample size (n) is the number of observations selected from a population to estimate population parameters accurately.

Choosing an appropriate sample size ensures:

Reliable results

Minimum error

Cost-effectiveness

2. Factors Affecting Sample Size

Confidence Level (Z)

Margin of Error (E)

Population Variability

Population Size (N) (if finite)

Type of Study (mean or proportion)

3. Common Confidence Levels & Z-Values
Confidence Level	    Z-value
90%	            1.645
95%	            1.96
99%	            2.576

4. Sample Size Formula (Population Mean)
n=(Z×σ​/E)2

Where:

Z = Z-value

σ = Standard deviation

E = Margin of error

5. Sample Size Formula (Population Proportion)
n=Z2×p×q/
  E2​
	​
Where:

p = estimated proportion

q = 1 − p

(If p unknown, use 0.5)

6. Sample Size with Finite Population Correction (FPC)
nadj​=n/1+n-1/N

7. Sample Size Calculator using Excel (Mean)
Example:

Confidence level = 95%

Standard deviation = 10

Margin of error = 2

Excel Formula:
=(1.96*10/2)^2


➡ Sample size = 96

8. Sample Size Calculator using Excel (Proportion)
Example:

Confidence level = 95%

p = 0.5

Margin of error = 5% (0.05)

Excel Formula:
=(1.96^2*0.5*0.5)/(0.05^2)


➡ Sample size = 384
